### Rule: 
1. `The First Roll`
The game of Ten Thousand is for any number of people and uses six dice. You can play the standard game or choose alternative rules. In the standard game, each player throws the dice, in turn. After the first roll, the player must remove one of the dice that was in a scoring combination. He continues to do this until he rolls a no-score or elects to stop and record his score.

2. `Scoring`
Points are scored as follows: One equals 100 points Five equals 50 points Three ones equal 1,000 points Three of any other number equals its face value times 100. For example, roll three twos and score 200 points, roll three fours and score 400 points. A run of one through six equals 3,000 points. Three pairs equals 1,000 points, which includes four of a kind plus a pair.

3. `Continuing Play`
The player keeps rolling the remaining dice and setting aside one die from each scoring combination. He must score each throw separately; for example, he can't use a three from his first roll and two threes from his second roll to make three of a kind. He keeps track of his points, adding each roll to the total, and he announces his score after every throw. He keeps playing until he has a zero throw and gets no score for the whole turn, or decides to stop. If a player has removed all six of his dice because they scored, he throws all six again and keeps scoring.

4. `How to Win`
The player who accumulates 10,000 points first is the winner. But if other players haven't yet finished their turns, they continue to play. If one of them scores higher than 10,000 points, she is the winner.

The winning score is 5,000 rather than 10,000.
